    ## Introduction
    Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are a type of large language model (LLM) and a prominent framework for generative artificial intelligence. 
    They are artificial neural networks that are used in natural language processing tasks. 
    GPTs are based on the transformer architecture, pre-trained on large data sets of unlabelled text, and able to generate novel human-like content. 
    As of 2024, most LLMs have these characteristics and are sometimes referred to broadly as GPTs.
